  <div class="package1"><p>FULL INTERIOR & EXTERIOR DETAILING</p><h4>Our full interior and exterior detailing package includes all the services you need to make your car look like new again. We start by making sure the interior of your car is spotless. We vacuum and shampoo it to remove debris or stains, clean the inside of the windows and polish any surfaces that could use a new shine. Once the interior of your car is completed, we start the exterior detailing. After making sure we cleaned every smudge and spot of dirt from the exterior of your car, we’ll seal it up with a wax coat to make sure it lasts longer. If you want your car to stay clean but hate cleaning it, this is the package for you.</h4></div>
